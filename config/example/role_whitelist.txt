# The format of this document is the person's ckey followed by their role permissions.
# You must list all permissions for a single ckey using one line.

# Casing does not matter, spacing does not matter, and underscores do not matter. 
# You may add any of the possible roles below, using different names as indicated.
# Adding two or more of the same role will not matter.
# A lot of the defines are just placeholders for right now.
